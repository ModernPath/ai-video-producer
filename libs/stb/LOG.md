# Build Log — STB (Story & Storyboard)

## 2026-07-23 — Context scaffolded (Prompt 0B)
**Done:** lib skeleton, empty ledger, build guide.
**Decisions:** contracts in `./contracts` (Zod canonical).
**Deferred:** ledger seeding → Prompt 1.
**Discovered:** —
**Follow-ups:** seed requirements from docs/13-storyboard.md.
**Gate:** n/a (no tests yet).

## 2026-07-23 — Ledger seeded (Prompt 1, compact)
**Done:** 10 REQs from docs/13; 4 READY (golden-thread shot mechanics), 6 PROPOSED compact.
**Decisions:** learning from GEN seed — PROPOSED rows stay one-liners until promoted (less ledger churn).
**Follow-ups:** Prompt 2 slice on 001–004 now.
**Gate:** n/a.

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 1: shot mechanics + golden thread (4 × READY → IN_REVIEW)
**Done:** REQ-STB-001..004 — duration bounds from config, strict ordering, single selection, ready-only take selection; requestFrame/requestTake enqueue via GEN; materializeGenerationOutput consumes completions into frame_candidate/take rows (docs/41 choreography, synchronous for now). Migration 0003. Web UI: projects + storyboard pages with server actions; dev-inline queue drain. Browser-verified: planned → framed → generated with selections.
**Decisions:** dev tenancy = auto "Local Studio" org until PLT auth (Phase 5). Dev-inline worker drain in server actions — replace with apps/worker + pg-boss (BACKLOG).
**Deviation (learning):** red-first was not strictly observed — tests and implementation were authored in one pass (GEN slice did observe it). Next slices: write + run failing tests before implementing.
**Deferred:** reorder command (part of REQ-STB-002 full scope) → next slice; fixture tiles are CSS gradients until AST storage serves real bytes.
**Discovered:** header "0/1 generated" briefly shown pre-refresh — revalidation is fine, no action.
**Follow-ups:** human review for 001–004; worker extraction; AST ledger seed.
**Gate:** full suite green (20 tests).

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 2: script studio (REQ-STB-008/011 → IN_REVIEW)
**Done:** red-first — draftScript → GEN kind `script` → script_version v1/v2 immutable with provenance; proposeShotPlan → kind `shot_plan` → stored proposal (mock plan: 3–7 in-bounds shots ≈ target length); applyShotPlan appends shots in order (additive MVP). GEN: text kinds land on generation.output (migration 0005), TextPromptInput + script/shot-plan assemblers. Web: /p/[id]/script page (draft, redraft, break-into-shots, apply) — browser-verified: brief → script v1 → 5-shot plan (28s/30s) → applied storyboard.
**Fixed:** migration race under parallel suites — pg_advisory_lock in migrator.
**Deferred:** revise-with-instruction chat UX; diff apply with paid-work protection (REQ-STB-007).
**Discovered:** server-action forms ignore clicks pre-hydration (bit us twice in browser tests) → BACKLOG (pending-state/disable until hydrated). Duplicate "Wake the City" project from an earlier double-submit → BACKLOG cleanup + idempotent create.
**Gate:** full suite 28/28 green.

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 3: music brief (REQ-STB-010 → IN_REVIEW)
**Done:** red-first — requestMusicBrief (GEN kind music_brief with script context), single-row-per-project upsert on materialize (regenerate replaces, provenance via generation_id), migration 0006; mock provider routes music_brief kind to a Suno-style fixture (style/mood/structure/length/context). Script page: MUSIC BRIEF card with generate/regenerate + handoff note. Browser-verified.
**Deferred (explicit):** track attach + mix modes → needs REQ-AST-004 presigned uploads; editable brief text (BR-STB-007 edit arm) with it.
**Gate:** 38/38 green.

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 3b: music track attach (REQ-STB-010 attach arm)
**Done:** attachMusicTrack (ready-audio-only guard, brief required) + test; script page upload/attach/replace UI with audio player; AnimaticPlayer plays the attached track under frames (BR-ASM-005 music arm). Browser-verified: track attached ✓, 0:30 player. Mix modes at export remain with REQ-ASM-004.
**Gate:** suite green.

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 4: candidate removal (REQ-STB-009 → IN_REVIEW)
**Done:** red-first — removeFrameCandidate/removeTake: soft-delete (deletedAt), selected-candidate removal rejected `conflict`, strips/animatic exclude removed, assets stay ready (INV-AST-003 provenance). ✕ remove chips on unselected candidates only. Browser+DB verified (frame 4d69: soft_deleted=t, asset ready).
**Completes:** user requirement #4's removal arm — every image/clip/script is now editable, regenerable, AND removable, with nothing selected/exported ever destroyed.
**Gate:** suite green.

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 5: video prompt + cast-aware script prompts (REQ-STB-012 → IN_REVIEW; USER directive)
**Done:** red-first — TextPromptInput.entities → CAST blocks in script/shot-plan/music assembly ("each shot's direction is a ready image prompt"; "reference cast members by name"); draftScript/proposeShotPlan/requestMusicBrief resolve the project cast. UI: video prompt on the create form + editable VIDEO PROMPT card on the script page (updateBriefAction). Browser: saved prompt → Redraft → v2 visibly built from it; DB snapshot has prompt text + CAST block.
**Also this tick (USER directive): Next.js 15.5 → 16.2.11** — build was type-checking workspace libs for the first time; fixed exactOptionalPropertyTypes/noUncheckedIndexedAccess sites in actions, page, executor, service types. Suite + build + browser green on 16.
**Gate:** 59 mock green (+4 real skipped); Next 16 production build clean.

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 6: per-shot image & video scripts (REQ-STB-013 → IN_REVIEW; USER FEEDBACK priority)
**Done:** red-first — shot.image_prompt/video_prompt (migration 0012); customPrompt in frame/take assembly (verbatim body + FORMAT line; auto-composed when empty); updateShotScripts (empty → back to auto); refs unaffected (entity images + start frame still attach). UI: SCRIPTS section on every shot card — both prompts fully visible (auto shown in-place), ref thumbnails beside labels, custom/auto badge, save. Browser+DB: custom image script → snapshot starts with the exact text, auto block gone, ref still attached.
**Also this tick:** REQ-GEN-005 + REQ-ASM-006 retries (int-tested, UI wired; GEN retry browser click-through pending — flaky click, mechanism verified by tests).
**Learning:** the invisible direction→prompt assembly was a real control failure (USER: "how can you otherwise try to get them right?") — 'what the model saw' is now 'what the model WILL see', editable. docs/features/shot-editor.md should absorb this pattern (BACKLOG).
**Gate:** 67 mock green (+4 real skipped).

## 2026-07-23 — STB slice 7: prose prompts + save&generate (REQ-STB-015 → IN_REVIEW) + spec revisit
**Done:** prompt template v2 — frame/take auto-prompts are natural cinematic prose (no ENTITY:/SHOT:/FORMAT: labels; USER: "horrible slop"); custom text verbatim + minimal format tail; tests updated red/green (68 mock). Save/Save&generate frame/Save&generate take on every scripts form — editing and firing generation is one gesture (USER: "how can I call image generation with the image prompt?"). Browser: prose autos verified; button click-through yielded to the user mid-session (they took the tab — actively testing).
**Spec revisit (USER):** canonical 3-step flow written into docs/00/06/13 + feature specs; REQ-STB-016 (per-shot refs) and REQ-STB-017 (first frames on apply) promoted READY as the identified gaps. REQ-STB-014 (plan-authored scripts) traced IN_REVIEW with int evidence.
**Gate:** 68 mock green (+4 real skipped).
