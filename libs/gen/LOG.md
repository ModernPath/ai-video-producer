# Build Log — GEN (Generation)

## 2026-07-23 — Context scaffolded (Prompt 0B)
**Done:** lib skeleton, empty ledger, build guide.
**Decisions:** contracts in `./contracts` (Zod canonical).
**Deferred:** ledger seeding → Prompt 1.
**Discovered:** —
**Follow-ups:** seed requirements from docs/14-generation.md.
**Gate:** n/a (no tests yet).

## 2026-07-23 — Ledger seeded (Prompt 1)
**Done:** 14 requirements derived from docs/14-generation.md; 6 READY for the Phase-1 golden thread (001, 002, 003, 007, 013, 015), 8 PROPOSED.
**Decisions:** REQ-GEN-014 (events) folded into 001/003 acceptance until it grows. Mock executor is a first-class requirement (015), not a test hack — it is the dev/CI path.
**Deferred:** quota check (004) → P5, needs PLT quota aggregate.
**Discovered:** image price placeholders already in BACKLOG inbox.
**Follow-ups:** Prompt 2 on the 6 READY requirements next.
**Gate:** n/a (no new code).

## 2026-07-23 — GEN slice 1: pipeline core (6 × READY → IN_REVIEW)
**Done:** REQ-GEN-001/002/003/007/013/015 — enqueue with full provenance snapshot, config-only routing, deterministic prompt assembly (template v1), cost from price table, mock executor completing queued generations into ready fixture assets. Migration 0002 (gen.generation, ast.asset). 16/16 tests green (unit + golden + integration vs compose pg).
**Decisions:** executor claims oldest queued (no pg-boss yet — fine single-worker; queue lib when apps/worker lands). Literal-scanner test enforces REQ-GEN-007 repo-wide.
**Deferred:** real provider path → REQ-GEN-010; object-storage writes (fixture:// keys) → AST slice; events/outbox → next slices.
**Discovered:** ast.asset created here as enabler — AST ledger seeding must note it (routed: AST LOG below).
**Follow-ups:** human review to move 6 reqs IN_REVIEW → DONE.
**Gate:** full suite 16/16 green.
